# Module Picker GUI Interface 

This program is developed to give the functionality of a working software which does basic things like save, load, exit as well as giving the ability to the users to pick their modules for De Montfort University: Computer Science and Software Engineering Modules.

Each selection of the modules will add up credits and by default the maximum range is 120 for any student.

The student can therefore pick their module of choice and by provide their student details. Once all of the necessary areas are filled in, this information gets saved and printed out to show the user what they have picked for future references. 

## To run the program

Get the copy of the program through this github page and make sure you have an appropriate development editor and Java SDK/JDK installed. 

This program was done using Eclipse Editor.
